# pen_source_scripted -- deterministic skirt strokes from a body and its
# 15-joint skeleton (util/skeleton15.gd), as the pen events a hand would make:
# pen_begin / pen_point / pen_end in the body-local frame (+Y up, metres).
#
#   waist ring at the pelvis joint's height, centred on the pelvis
#   hem ring at the knees' mean height, centred between the knees
#   each ring as two half-rings, left (+x) and right (-x), meeting at the
#   front (+z) and the back (-z), so no stroke is closed and Cassie's
#   closed-stroke split is not needed (closed_rings = true draws each ring as
#   one closed stroke instead, for that path)
#   a front seam and a back seam from waist to hem, ending exactly on the
#   ring points
#
# Ring radius: the largest horizontal distance, from the ring centre, of body
# vertices within BAND of the ring's height, + CLEARANCE. Vertices farther than
# 0.6 x the nearest wrist's horizontal distance are left out (FoxGirl's hands
# hang at pelvis height: the torso ends at 0.16 m, the hands start at 0.34 m).
# Then both rings grow by the same amount if the straight cone between them
# would pass closer than CLEARANCE to the body (FoxGirl's hips: the rings
# alone leave it 2.5 cm inside), since fit_begin refuses a garment that starts
# intersecting the body.
#
# The rings are boundary strokes (curvenet's "boundary" pen mode, captured at
# pen_begin; the begin event carries it): a cycle made only of them is an
# opening, the waist or the hem, and gets no patch. Without the mark the two
# rings' caps are surfaced too (4 patches), since the network alone cannot
# tell a cap from an opening (gates/4-curvenet/README.md, skirt (b)).
#
# The sketch graph this should give: 4 knots (waist/hem x front/back), each of
# degree 3 (two half-rings and a seam), 6 edges by the handshake lemma (4 x 3 /
# 2), and 2 cycles (the front and the back panel) plus 2 openings, so 2 patches. The Cut 8
# task text says "8 curves"; 4 knots of degree 3 cannot have 8 edges, so the
# gate records the curvenet's own count and checks it against the knots.
